A postgreSQL database is provisioned on a client machine using docker, and a bash agent collects relevant information to be stored within the database tables. In addition, the afformention inforation is retrived at periodical intervals with Crontab, and the database is queried using SQL.",

Tested with JUnit and Mockito, various integration tests and unit tests were done to ensure that to project is working correctly. In addition, spring framework is also applied to handle dependency management and injection concerns.",

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed to update the database, and they manipulate and modify relevant information; here, the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern is used while the database is queried using SQL.",
        "Grep App: Created a grep app in Java that allows for the search of files within a root directory and its subdirectories, returning all lines containing a specified regular expression. The app is very similar to the grep command in Linux, and also uses stream APIs and lambda notation to handle insufficient memory problems"

Through programming, I am able to enjoy the wide range of problems that it can let me solve, as well as the many complexed challenges that accompany working towards a well structured solution. Pertaining to this, I have utilized many technologies (such as Java, RDBMS, Docker, Linux, Springboot) to complete my recent projects. I have also tutored high school students in mathematics and programming. Coding is an excellent tool to utilize in solving many various problems that we encounter in our lives, and can also be used to make our lives substantially easier if applied correctly."
