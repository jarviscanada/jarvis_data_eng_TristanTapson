A postgreSQL database is provisioned on a client machine using docker, and a bash agent collects relevant information to be stored within the database tables. In addition, the afformention inforation is retrived at periodical intervals with Crontab, and the database is queried using SQL.",

The app is very similar to the grep command in Linux, and also uses stream APIs and lambda notation to handle insufficient memory."

Since high school, I have always enjoyed the wide range of problems that programming can let me solve, as well as the many complexed challenges that accompany working towards a well structured solution. I have also tutored high school students in mathematics and programming. Coding is an excellent tool to utilize in solving many various problems that we encounter in our lives, and can also be used to make our lives substantially easier if applied correctly."
