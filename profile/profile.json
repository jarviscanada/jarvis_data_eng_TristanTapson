A postgreSQL database is provisioned on a client machine using docker, and a bash agent collects relevant information to be stored within the database tables. In addition, the afformention inforation is retrived at periodical intervals with Crontab, and the database is queried using SQL.",

Tested with JUnit and Mockito, various integration tests and unit tests were done to ensure that to project is working correctly. In addition, spring framework is also applied to handle dependency management and injection concerns.",

To deploy, a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline is utilized to build, test, and deploy continuously over the project lifecycle.",
