# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent McMaster University Computer Science graduate looking to practice my skills in a professional environment; currently, I am working for Jarvis Consulting as a software developer. Since high school, I have always enjoyed the wide range of problems that programming can let me solve, as well as the many complexed challenges that accompany working towards a well structured solution. I have also tutored high school students in mathematics and programming. Coding is an excellent tool to utilize in solving many various problems that we encounter in our lives, and can also be used to make our lives substantially easier if applied correctly.

    description: Developed a linux cluster monitoring agent that stored key hardware information and usage within a database within a client-server architecture. A postgreSQL database is provisioned on a client machine using docker, and a bash agent collects relevant information to be stored within the database tables. In addition, the afformention inforation is retrived at periodical intervals with Crontab, and the database is queried using SQL.

      - "JDBC App: Implemented a JDBC app that connects to a postgreSQL database. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed to update the database, and they manipulate and modify relevant information; here, the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern is used while the database is queried using SQL."
      - "Grep App: Created a grep app in Java that allows for the search of files within a root directory and its subdirectories, returning all lines containing a specified regular expression. The app is very similar to the grep command in Linux, and also uses stream APIs and lambda notation to handle insufficient memory."
